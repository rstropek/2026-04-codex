/**
 * Step 1 View — the *iframe* side of an MCP App.
 *
 * MCP-Apps concepts on display:
 *  • `new App(...).connect()` opens the postMessage channel to the host.
 *  • `app.ontoolresult` fires every time the bound tool returns. The host
 *    delivers BOTH `content` (for the model) and `structuredContent` (for us).
 *    A View should prefer `structuredContent` — it stays typed and avoids
 *    re-parsing the human-readable text the model sees.
 *  • Setting handlers BEFORE `connect()` guarantees we don't miss the very
 *    first tool result, which the host may push immediately after init.
